    <h2><u>Projects</u></h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><u>deep learning framework for drug side effect prediction:</u></strong><pre> 
        
-Developed deep learning models to predict drug side effects using the LINCS L1000 gene expression dataset, leveraging both chemical structure (CS) and gene expression (GEX) data for enhanced predictive accuracy.

-Experimented with five architectures, identifying a multi-modal model combining CS and GEX as the most effective MLP-based approach, while a CNN using SMILES representations achieved the best overall performance.

-Achieved 13.0% macro-AUC and 3.1% micro-AUC improvements over the state-of-the-art, demonstrating the potential of deep learning for improving drug safety and design processes./</li>
    <li><strong><u>integrated car rental system</u></strong><pre>
        
-Developed an “Integrated Car Booking & Rental Platform” using Spring Boot, designed to streamline operations for car rental companies with a role-based access system for Admins, Employees, and Customers.

-Implemented core functionalities including car and rental management, user authentication, and administrative control, leveraging Spring MVC, JPA, and H2/MySQL for robust data handling and scalability.

-Built a modular, enterprise-level web application ensuring data integrity, maintainability, and readiness for production deployment, demonstrating proficiency in modern Java technologies.
